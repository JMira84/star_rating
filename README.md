# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a star rating.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- See five star outlines
- When the user hovers over the first star, it changes into a solid star
- When the user hovers over the second star, it shows the first and second star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the third star, it shows the first, second, and third star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the fourth star, it shows the first, second, third, and fourth star as a solid star.
- When the user hovers over the fifth star, it shows the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth star as a solid star.

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
